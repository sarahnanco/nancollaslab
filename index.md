# Welcome to the Marine Biology Lab
We are dedicated to advancing the understanding of marine ecosystems.  
Our team combines **fieldwork, laboratory analysis, and computational modeling** to uncover the mysteries of the ocean.  

Located at the University of [Your Institution], our research spans **coral reefs, biodiversity surveys, and marine conservation**.
